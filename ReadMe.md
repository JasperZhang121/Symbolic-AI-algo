## Welcome to my AI Algorithms Repository
- I am currently enrolled in an AI course and find the different algorithms quite fascinating. As a result, I have created this repository to document my learning journey and write about various AI algorithms as I progress through the course.


- The first part of this repository will focus on search algorithms. I will be adding more content as I continue to learn and explore new topics in AI. 


- I would try to give detailed docstring for each algorithm.
