Symbolic AI Algorithms Repository
---

## Summary:

I'm excited to explore Symbolic AI and its different algorithms and logic reasoning. To document my learning journey and for future reference, I have created this repository. As I progress my learning journey, I will write about various AI algorithms and concepts.

---

## Contents and Prerequisites:

- The first part of this repository will focus on search algorithms. I will continue to add more content as I learn and explore new topics in AI.

- The second part is about constraint satisfaction problems, mostly. If you're interested in logical reasoning or KRR, check out:
  - [Vaults](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Vaults/tree/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/Symbolic%20AI/3.%20KRR)  
  - [Logic](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Logic)

- The renowned book, [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Symbolic-AI-algo/tree/master/AIMA_3rd_edition), has been uploaded to the folder. Even if you're a fan of ML, you can still have some fun exploring the book to learn more about traditional AI.

## Specifications:

For search algorithms, I will not use a tree, but instead, I will use mazes, graphs, and grids created by dictionaries or nested dictionaries or my own data structure called grid. When there's a distance or cost associated with moving between places, it will be considered.

## Extra:

I will provide detailed docstrings for each algorithm.
