## Welcome to my AI Algorithms Repository
- I am currently enrolled in an AI course and find the different algorithms quite fascinating. As a result, I have created this repository to document my learning journey/future review and write about various AI algorithms as I progress through the course.


- The first part of this repository will focus on search algorithms. I will be adding more content as I continue to learn and explore new topics in AI. 


- Will not use and Tree for search but some mazes/graphs/grid which is created by dictionary or nested dictionary or my own data structure called grid. when there's a distance/cost moving between places.


- I would try to give detailed docstring for each algorithm.
