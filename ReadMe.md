Symbolic AI Algorithms Repository
---

## Summary:

_I'm excited to explore Symbolic AI and its different algorithms and logic reasoning. To document my learning journey and for future reference, I have created this repository. As I progress my learning journey, I will write about various AI algorithms and concepts._

---

## Contents and Prerequisites:

- _The first part of this repository will focus on search algorithms. I will continue to add more content as I learn and explore new topics in AI._
   - BFS/ DFS/ IDS
   - UCS/ Gready/ A-star
   - Min-max/ Alpha-beta prunning
   - ReadME: [Z_Algo_Details.md](Algo/Z_Algo_Details.md)

- _The second part is about constraint satisfaction problems._ 
  - Constraint graph
  - Variable selection heuristic
  - Value ordering heuristic
  - Arc consistency
  - ReadME: [Z_Mapping_Problem.md](CSP/Z_Mapping_Problem.md)
 
- _The third part is about planning, covering things such as:_
  - Linear/non-linear/Serial/Parallel plan
  - Different planning algorithm
  - STRIPS, PDDL, ADL

- _If you're interested in logical reasoning or KRR, check out:_
  - [KRR](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Vaults/tree/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/Symbolic%20AI/2.%20KRR/0.%20Concepts) 
  - [Logic](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Logic)
    
- _The renowned book, [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Symbolic-AI-algo/tree/master/AIMA_3rd_edition), has been uploaded to the folder. Even if you're a fan of ML, you can still have some fun exploring the book to learn more about traditional AI._

- _If you're interested in exploring more usage of search algorithms, I invite you to take a look at my [Algorithm](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/Algorithm) repository. Additionally, you can further practice and test your skills on platforms like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)._

## Specifications:

_For search algorithms, I will not use a tree, but instead, I will use mazes, graphs, and grids created by dictionaries or nested dictionaries or my own data structure called grid. When there's a distance or cost associated with moving between places, it will be considered._

## Extra:

_I will provide detailed docstrings for each algorithm._
